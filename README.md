# Mansalva
This project involves the creation of an informal handwritten font to be used for making comments on lecture slides. It is a handwritten font that has good legibility and can be used for short notes or with other purposes, as it has a complete set of characters, including some languages support. Mansalva features two alternates for each letter to create a more natural handwritten look.

The original aim of this project was to create a handwritten font that can be used for notes and informal text. It started as an experiment during idle time, and it turns out as a script with a good flow, so I’ve decided to develop the whole set. 
I had a copy of FontSelf Maker that I always wanted to try, and it turned out to be an easy to use tool that will allow the creation of quick fonts and icons. So the beginning of this font was on FontSelf Maker with Adobe Illustrator. It’s easy to use, and I was surprised that provides many useful features as tracking and kerning tools. 
Once the project was more advanced, I’ve decided to move onto Glyphs. The final development of the font, refinement and alternates was developed using Glyphs.

Mansalva gets its name from the Spanish expression _a mano salva_ that originally means “simply with your hand “. Nowadays, the expression _a mansalva_ is used to mean abundance, close range, or without risk. 
This version of the font was created using a regular marker. I plan to add more styles in the future, using different tools to make some other styles to match a _light_ weight. It is still a work in progress, critique and comments are welcome.

Recent updates include 2 sets of alternates, including the numbers, fixes in kerning and additional language support, including Māori.
